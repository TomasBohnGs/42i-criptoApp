# 42i - Crypto App

### Objective

The app, throw a minimalistic and clean interphase, wants to help crypto investors to track and control their investments.
<br>
The app count with three windows:
<br>
**1- Home:** 
<br>On this screen, the user would have a full control over his crypto investments. Also, at the right bottom corner, he would find a plus button to add a new crypto to his tracking list.
<br>
**2- Search Cripto:**
<br>Once the user taps over the plus button, he would find a new screen with an interactive search bar. This search bar acts as a filter on the crypto list display below.
<br>This crypto list is control with the available cryptos for the moment.
<br>
**3- Cripto Form:**
<br>After selecting the crypto they want, the user would be redirected to the final screen.
<br>At this point, the user would see the crypto he selected, and with a controlled from, he would be able to select the currency on which he wants to see the total amount and how much money he invested on that currency.
<br>After confirming on the violet button, he would be redirected to the home screen, where it would see the updated list of cryptos.
### Tech Stack

**React Native** - React Native Paper
<br>
Having in mind that the project was developed for Flutter and Mock-Ups were done mobile first, I decided to take my React knowledge to the mobile world and developed this app on React Native.
